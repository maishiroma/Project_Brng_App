## Summary
__Project Boomerang__ is an upcoming 2D fighter game that pits people against each other in a (TBD) environment. The main gimmick of the game is the weapons that players will use to attack each other. Instead of guns, fists, swords, or even magic, players must use their trusty boomerang to attack their opponents! A boomerang offers a unique attack style where players can angle them in unique directions to attack opponents at a wide varitiy of angles.

This game takes some inspiration from an indie game called [TowerFall](http://www.towerfall-game.com/) as well as a small mechanic that was present as a character skill in the [Kirby](https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Cutter) series.

## Project Features
- Created in Unreal Engine 4
- Local/Online Multiplayer
